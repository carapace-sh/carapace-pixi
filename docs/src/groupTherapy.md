# Group Therapy

![](./groupTherapy/banner.png)

Values can not only be [styled], they can also be [tagged].
The former may signify the state of a value, and the latter classify it.

## Implicit

Subcommands are implicitly [tagged] and [styled] based on their group.

Other values can be [tagged] explicitly.
