# In A Nutshell

![](./inANutshell/banner.png)

[Carapace] is a shell completion library ([carapace-sh/carapace]) as well as a binary containing a collection of shell completers ([carapace-sh/carapace-bin]).
It works across multiple operating systems and multiple POSIX and non-POSIX shells.

## Getting Started

Refer to [Install] and [Setup] to get it up and running on your system.

> You can use any shell you want, but it is highly recommended to give [Elvish](https://elv.sh) a try.
> Not only shows it best what [Carapace] can do. It is pretty awesome anyway.
